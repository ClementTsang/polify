# TODO

The goal is to make this a ``.github.io`` tool.  As such, we're writing this fully in... WebAssembly!  Yay, we get to use Rust!

## Components

- Figure out an image library that allows input and mutation

- Figure out and write a poly algorithm

- UI - either JS it, TS it, PS it, Yew it, whatever.

  - Needs input button, output window and option to save
  
  - Maybe options to tweak?
